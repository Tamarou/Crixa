  [BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES]

  * Switched from using Net::RabbitMQ to Net::AMQP::RabbitMQ. The former no
    longer passes its tests with recent versions of RabbitMQ.

  * The Crixa class no longer has a ->channels method and it no longer stores
    channels internally. Instead, you call $crixa->new_channel whenever you
    want a new channel.

  * The Crixa class no longer has ->queue or ->exchange methods. This was
    convenient, but made the handling of channels really confusing. Instead,
    you should create a channel and use that to create queues and exchanges.

  * Removed the Crixa::Channel->publish method. Use Crixa::Exchange objects to
    publish messages instead. If you really want to publish without an
    exchange name, you can create an exchange object with an empty string as
    its name.

  * Removed the Crixa::Queue->publish method. This really doesn't make sense,
    since you can't publish to queues. This method would only have worked with
    certain configurations, and it would have been easy to create an
    exchange/queue combination where calling Crixa::Queue->publish sent the
    message to an entirely different queue.

  * The Crixa::Exchange->queue method's "bindings" parameter has been renamed
    to "routing_keys". This is a better match for how these things are
    described in the RabbitMQ docs.

  * Messages are now objects. See the Crixa::Message documentation for details.

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  * Added complete documentation for every class. The docs try to explain
    RabbitMQ concepts wherever appropriate.

  * Added a Crixa::Exchange->delete method.

  * Added a Crixa::Queue->delete method.

  * Added a Crixa::Queue->bind method.

  * All the settings that can be passed to the constructor for Exchange &
    Queue objects are now available as object attributes. This includes things
    like "durable", "auto_delete", etc.
